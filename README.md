# Transfer a Spotify Playlist to YouTube Music

A simple command line script to clone a Spotify playlist to YouTube Music.

- Transfer a single Spotify playlist
- Transfer all playlists for a Spotify user


## Requirements

- Python 3 - https://www.python.org
- Python extensions: `pip install -U -r requirements`
- Have made at least one playlist manually on YouTube Music

## Setup

1. Initially you should create a new `settings.ini` containing your Spotify credentials.

Simply copy `settings.ini.example` to a new file `settings.ini`:

```zsh
$ cp settings.ini.example settings.ini
```

2. Generate a new app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard

3. Fill in your `client_id` and `client_secret` from your Spotify app

4. For YouTube Music, open a console in the source code folder and run

`python Setup.py youtube`

5. Open your browser and copy your request headers according to the instructions at https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html. 
   Paste them into the terminal to proceed.

This Setup.py procedure stores all credentials locally in the file `settings.ini`.

## Transfer a playlist

After you've created the settings file, you can simply run the script from the command line using:

`python YouTube.py <spotifylink>`

where `<spotifylink>` is a link like https://open.spotify.com/user/edmsauce/playlist/3yGp845Tz2duWCORALQHFO
Alternatively you can also **use a file name** in place of a spotify link. The file should contain one song per line.

The script will log its progress and output songs that were not found in YouTube Music to **noresults.txt**.

## Transfer all playlists of a Spotify user

For migration purposes, it is possible to transfer all public playlists of a user by using the Spotify user's ID (unique username).

`python YouTube.py --all <spotifyuserid>`


## Command line options

There are some additional command line options for setting the playlist name and determining whether it's public or not. To view them, run

`> python YouTube.py -h`

Arguments:
