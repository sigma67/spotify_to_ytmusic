A simple command line script to clone a Spotify playlist to YouTube Music.

- Transfer a single Spotify playlist
- Update a transferred playlist on YouTube Music
- Transfer all playlists for a Spotify user
- Remove playlists from YouTube Music


Install
-------

- Python 3 and pip - https://www.python.org
- Install:

.. code-block::

    pip install spotify_to_ytmusic


Setup
-------

1. Generate a new app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Run

.. code-block::

    spotify_to_ytmusic setup

For backwards compatibility you can also create your own file and pass it using ``--file settings.ini``.

If you want to transfer private playlists from Spotify (i.e. liked songs), choose "yes" for oAuth authentication, otherwise choose "no".
For oAuth authentication you should set ``http://localhost`` as redirect URI for your app in Spotify's developer dashboard.

Usage
------

After you've completed setup, you can simply run the script from the command line using:

.. code-block::

    spotify_to_ytmusic create <spotifylink>

where ``<spotifylink>`` is a link like https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0S0cuX8pnvmF7gA47Eu63M

The script will log its progress and output songs that were not found in YouTube Music to **noresults.txt**.

Transfer all playlists of a Spotify user
----------------------------------------

For migration purposes, it is possible to transfer all public playlists of a user by using the Spotify user's ID (unique username).

.. code-block::

    spotify_to_ytmusic all <spotifyuserid>

Transfer liked tracks of the Spotify user
-----------------------------------------

**You must you oAuth authentication for transferring liked songs.**

.. code-block::

   spotify_to_ytmusic liked

This command will open browser where you should give access to your account (if you haven't done that before).
After authorization you will be redirected to localhost, copy link you were redirected to (looks like localhost/?code=...) and paste to command line.
